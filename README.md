# Green Stocks Analysis
A practical analysis of green energy stock trends to evaluate risk for potential investors.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to allow the end user the ability to analyze stock performance for 2017 and 2018 green stocks. With our source code, we have worked to refactor and streamline the macros to run faster and more efficiently on the machine.

## Results
I was unable to get this macro to process correctly.

## Summary
**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
*Refactoring code has the clear advantage of making a block of code more efficient for a computer to run and easier for other coders to read.*
**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**
*With this project, we tracked the time it took for the computer to process the required analysis, and saw a marked improvement in run time once the code was refactoed.*
